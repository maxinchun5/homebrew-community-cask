# Homebrew Cask — Community Tap

This repository is a **community-driven tap** built on top of [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask). It has one clear mission: to keep software installable when the official tap can't.

## Why This Tap Exists

There are two kinds of casks that end up here:

### **1. Casks disabled by the official tap.**

When Gatekeeper checks cause a cask to be removed from `homebrew/cask`, it would normally be lost — no more installs, no more version bumps. This tap catches those casks and keeps them alive. They are still monitored for new releases, so you stay up to date even after the official tap moves on.

### **2. Unsigned apps from the community.**

Independent developers and community members often ship great software that isn't signed or notarized. The official tap won't take it. This tap will. It's an open space for those apps to be published, installed, and maintained through Homebrew.

In short: if it works, and you want to install it with `brew`, this tap is for you.

## Getting Started

First, add the tap:

```console
% brew tap maxinchun5/community-cask
```

Then install any cask from it:

```console
% brew install --cask appium-inspector
==> Fetching downloads for: appium-inspector
✔︎ Cask appium-inspector (1.0.0)                                           Verified      5.6MB/  5.6MB
==> Installing Cask appium-inspector
==> Moving App 'Appium Inspector.app' to '/Applications/Appium Inspector.app'
🍺  appium-inspector was successfully installed!
```

One tap, one command, no dialogs. No dragging icons into folders.

## Something Broke?

Start here: run `brew update-reset && brew update`, then try again. This resets all your taps to a clean state and fixes most problems caused by stale local data.
